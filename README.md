# Frontend Mentor - Product list with cart solution

This is my solution to the [Product list with cart challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**NOTE: I did not have access to the Figma/Sketch file, so the design is far from being pixel perfect.**
